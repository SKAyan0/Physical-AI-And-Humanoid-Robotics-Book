# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to the first module of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book! In this module, you'll learn about ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), which serves as the nervous system for robots.

## Overview

ROS 2 provides the middleware that allows different parts of a robot to communicate with each other. In this module, we'll cover:

- Introduction to Middleware: ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services
- Bridging Digital Agents: Controlling Robots with Python (rclpy)
- Defining the Body: URDF for Humanoid Kinematics

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this module, you'll understand how to:

- Create and manage ROS 2 nodes
- Establish communication between different robot components
- Control robots using Python
- Define robot structure using URDF

Let's begin our journey into the world of robotics!
