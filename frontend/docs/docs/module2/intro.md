# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

In this module, you'll learn about digital twins in robotics, focusing on simulation environments that mirror real-world robotic systems.

## Overview

A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical robot or system. In this module, we'll explore:

- Physics Simulation: Gravity, Collisions, and Environment in Gazebo
- Visual Fidelity: Rendering and Human-Robot Interaction in Unity
- Sensory Input: Simulating LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this module, you'll understand how to:

- Set up realistic physics simulations
- Create visually accurate representations of robots
- Simulate various sensor types
- Bridge simulation and real-world robot behavior

Let's explore the world of digital twins in robotics!
